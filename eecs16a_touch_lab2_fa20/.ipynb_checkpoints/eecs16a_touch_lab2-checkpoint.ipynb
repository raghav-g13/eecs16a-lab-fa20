We can use the Launchpad to automate this process, with a script that will rapidly switch the measurement mode of the resistive touchscreen between powering the Top Mesh and powering the Bottom Mesh. \n",
    "<br> Switching between the two modes quickly will enable us to effectively receive the X and Y positions at the same time during the duration of a single touch. This relies on the assumption that we cannot touch and retract our finger faster than the MSP being able to toggle between the two modes, which is on the order a few milliseconds."
